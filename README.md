# Mastering-Microcontroller-and-Embedded-Driver-Development-STM32F302R8T6

### This repo is my recreation of the course "[Mastering Microcontroller and Embedded Driver Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-microcontroller-with-peripheral-driver-development/)" on Udemy. My STM32 MCU was different from the one the instructor used so the text files are programs written for the STM32F302 Nucleo64.
