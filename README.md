# Mastering-Microcontroller-and-Embedded-Driver-Development-STM32F302R8T6

### This repo is my recreation of the course "Mastering Microcontroller and Embedded Driver Development" on Udemy. My STM32 MCU was different from the one the instructor used so the text files are programs written for the STM32F302 Nucleo64.
