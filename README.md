# Not all functions have been tested yet nor am I complete with the course. This may result in bugs so, USE WITH CAUTION!!!!!!

### This repo is my recreation of the course "[Mastering Microcontroller and Embedded Driver Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-microcontroller-with-peripheral-driver-development/)" on Udemy. My STM32 MCU was different from the one the instructor used so the text files are programs written for the STM32F302 Nucleo64.
